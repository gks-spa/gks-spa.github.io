# An Unmaintained/Machine Account for Gabriel Konar-Steenberg
## Explain?
I created a GitHub account in high school. Its username was gks-spa, after the initials of my name and my high school's name. After I graduated high school, I changed its username to GabrielKS. I then created another account, this one, whose username is gks-spa. I do not plan to maintain this account. Because of how Git and GitHub work, sometimes you will see gks-spa on my old work and be directed here, but really you should go to [https://github.com/GabrielKS](https://github.com/GabrielKS).

## I saw gks-spa somewhere.
That most likely refers to a commit I made during high school. If you're interested in what I'm doing now, see [https://github.com/GabrielKS](https://github.com/GabrielKS).

## Why this account, then?
This account can serve as my "machine account," but I do not plan to maintain it beyond that. It's useful for hosting the information you are currently reading, explaining that you should go to [https://github.com/GabrielKS](https://github.com/GabrielKS) instead.

## How does this affect me?
Just pretend you've been redirected to [https://github.com/GabrielKS](https://github.com/GabrielKS).
